export const studentIdentifiersPrompt = "Can you help me understand if my program has good variable names? My professor told us the following to consdier about style: 'Variable and function naming are important things to consider when writing a program for several reasons: Readability: Well-named variables and functions can make the code more readable and understandable. The name should describe the purpose and function of the variable or function, making it easier for other developers to understand what the code does.Maintainability: A well-named variable or function makes it easier to maintain and update the code. If a variable or function is poorly named, it can be difficult to figure out what it does or how it is used, which can lead to errors and bugs. Reusability: Naming conventions can help create reusable code. A well-named function or variable can be easily reused in other parts of the program, or even in other programs. Consistency: Consistent naming conventions can make the code more consistent and easier to understand. If all variables and functions are named consistently, it is easier to understand how the code works as a whole.' In addition, she told us not to use python key words as variable names." 


export const profIdentifiersPrompt = 'I am hoping you can help me provide style feedback by suggesting better function and variable names. Below is a dictionary that has all of the function and variable names in the student program. In the dictionary, each key is a variable or function name name and its value is the python code used to assign that variable to a value. Give back a JSON dictionary where the key is each variable name and the value is another dictionary. Each inner dictionary has a key "name_misleads_type" which stores whether the variable name is misleading about the type of value it stores. The only type to consider are ints, floats, and strings. A misleading name would have the name of another type, or a subset of the name in its variable name. Each inner dictionary also has a score for how descriptive and accurate that variable name is where 0 is not at all and 1 is very. Each inner dictionary also has a key "alternative_names" which is a list of alternative names that are more descriptive for that variable. When determining alternate names, look at the value for this variable in the below dictionary. For all variables where the name misleads the type, ensure that the alternative names describe the correct type that it actually stores in the above dictionary.  descriptive. Each inner dictionary also has a key "why" which maps to a list of one string that explains why the alternative name is better.'
